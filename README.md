In this project I will be using SQL to explore Twitch's Streaming and Chat Data.
~This project was transferred here from codecademy

The following will be examined:
- What games are being watched on Twitch
- What channels are users watching?
- What are the most popular games in this data set?
- How big is the League of Legends viewerbase and where are they located?
- What sources are viewers using to view streams?
- Classifying games into genres:
- What hours dring the day have the most viewers?
